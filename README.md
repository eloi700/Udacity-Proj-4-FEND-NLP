## Project 4 -Language Identification & URL Evaluation with Natural Language Processing

The project is building a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on news article or blogs.

One of the highlight of this project is using a Webpack.  Webpack is a tool that compiles JavaScript modules, known as module bundler.  This enables to take a fully dynamic application and package it into static files, which can the be uploaded and deployed to the server.

Before anything else, I set up first the project by installing npm, the required dependencies as well devDependencies.

API also required in the project hence, setting it up using MeaningCloud API has been used.  I provided also Environment Variables to hide the key publicly by installing dotenv and creating .env file in the root of this project.

In addition to above, project was also enhanced, test using jest framework, set up service workers (web app offline) and deployed it via Heroku.
